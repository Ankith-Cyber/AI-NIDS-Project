# AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

[cite_start]This project is a web-based dashboard that uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to detect malicious network traffic[cite: 15].

## Features
- [cite_start]**Synthetic Data Generation:** Mimics real-world network traffic logs[cite: 23].
- [cite_start]**Live Simulator:** Test manual packet entries for instant classification[cite: 88].
- [cite_start]**Visual Analytics:** View model accuracy and confusion matrices[cite: 78, 80].
